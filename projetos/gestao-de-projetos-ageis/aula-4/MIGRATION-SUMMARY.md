# Three.js Module Migration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Dependencies
- âœ… `package.json` already had the correct Three.js dependency (`three: ^0.158.0`)

### 2. JavaScript Files Converted to ES6 Modules

#### `js/game.js`
- Added `import * as THREE from 'three';`
- Changed `class Game` to `export class Game`
- Exported global game instance: `export let game;`

#### `js/player.js`
- Added `import * as THREE from 'three';`
- Changed `class Player` to `export class Player`
- Changed `class Bullet` to `export class Bullet`

#### `js/enemies.js`
- Added `import * as THREE from 'three';`
- Changed `class Enemy` to `export class Enemy`
- Changed `class EnemyBullet` to `export class EnemyBullet`
- Changed `class Civilian` to `export class Civilian`

#### `js/weapons.js`
- Added `import * as THREE from 'three';`
- Changed `class Weapon` to `export class Weapon`
- Changed `class Medicine` to `export class Medicine`
- Changed `class WeaponSpawner` to `export class WeaponSpawner`
- Changed `class MedicineSpawner` to `export class MedicineSpawner`

#### `js/environment.js`
- Added `import * as THREE from 'three';`
- Changed `class Environment` to `export class Environment`
- Changed `class ParticleSystem` to `export class ParticleSystem`

#### `js/main.js`
- Added imports for all classes and Three.js:
  ```javascript
  import * as THREE from 'three';
  import { Game } from './game.js';
  import { Player, Bullet } from './player.js';
  import { Enemy, EnemyBullet, Civilian } from './enemies.js';
  import { Weapon, Medicine, WeaponSpawner, MedicineSpawner } from './weapons.js';
  import { Environment, ParticleSystem } from './environment.js';
  ```
- Made `restartGame` function available globally: `window.restartGame = restartGame;`

### 3. HTML File Updated
#### `index.html`
- Removed all individual script tags:
  ```html
  <!-- REMOVED -->
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r158/three.min.js"></script>
  <script src="js/game.js"></script>
  <script src="js/player.js"></script>
  <script src="js/enemies.js"></script>
  <script src="js/weapons.js"></script>
  <script src="js/environment.js"></script>
  <script src="js/main.js"></script>
  ```
- Added single module script tag:
  ```html
  <script type="module" src="js/main.js"></script>
  ```

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Better Dependency Management**: Three.js is now properly managed through npm
2. **ES6 Module System**: Clean imports/exports instead of global variables
3. **Tree Shaking**: Unused Three.js code can be eliminated during bundling
4. **Better IDE Support**: Better autocomplete and error detection
5. **Modern JavaScript**: Uses current JavaScript standards
6. **Maintainability**: Clearer dependencies between modules

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start development server: `npm start`
3. Open browser to `http://localhost:8080`

## Notes

- All functionality remains the same
- The game should work identically to the previous version
- The `restartGame` function is still accessible from the HTML button
- No breaking changes to the game logic or user experience
